##Compile and run
Check out all source code, including the Makefile and .txt files.

Type ```make``` to compile the sources, you will get executable file *"entropy"*.

Type ```./entropy -k=100000 -fin=fin_sample.txt``` to experiment on the fingerprint sample "fin\_sample.txt" which is the statistic of 3,000 samples generated by the uniform distribution over 100,000 symbols. 

Both *k* and *fin* must be provided. 
Optinal arguments:

* ```-L=number```: set polynomial degree. Default *L=1.6 log k*.
* ```-M=number```: set the right endpoint of approximation interval. Default *M=3.5 log k*.
* ```-N=number```: set the threshold to apply the polynomial estimator. Default *N=1.6 log k*.
* The parameters above can be combined, e.g., ```./entropy -k=100000 -fin=fin_sample.txt -L=18 -M=40 -N=18```.
* Type ```./entropy -help``` or ```./entropy -h``` to see the list of arguements.



## More for developers
For developer who want to write a new test scratch to test the entropy estimator, follow the sample code *main_test.cpp*.
After ```make``` you will also see the executable file *"test"*.

### Entropy estimator: *Entropy* class
Workflow: 

1. Set alphabet size *k* and several parameters: 
  * **setDegree(int L)**: the degree of polynomial is L.
  * **setInterval(int M)**: the approximation interval is [0,M/n], where n is the sample size.
  * **setThreshold(int N)**: the threshold to use polynomial estimator is when the histogram is at most N.
2. Input fingerprint with **setFin( filename )** or **setFin(freq, count)**. 
  * Each line of file consists of two numbers: frequency *j*, the number of symbols that appears exactly *j* times.
  * Input two vectors of the same length: *freq[i]* represents frequency, and *cnt[i]* represents the number of symbols that appear exactly *freq[i]* times. 
3. Output various estimates: 
  * **estimate()**: our polynomial estimator
  * **estimate_plug()**: plug-in estimator
  * **estimate\_Miller\_Madow()**: Miller-Madow estimator



### Synthetic data experiments
For those who want to generate random samples within C++, you can refer to the internal [random number generator facilities](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/).
There are sample codes to generate random numbers according to different types of distributions.
For general purpose, you can use [discrete distribution](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/discrete_distribution/).


## Reference
For detailed explanation of parameters, please refer to the paper [Minimax rates of entropy estimation on large alphabets via best polynomial approximation, arXiv:1407.0381](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0381).
The paramters described in the paper are: *L=c<sub>0</sub> log k, M=c<sub>1</sub> log k, N=c<sub>2</sub> log k*.
As in the paper, the default values are *L=1.6 log k, M=3.5 log k, N=1.6 log k*.
