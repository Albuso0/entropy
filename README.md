#Tutorial

##Compile and run
Check out all source code, including the Makefile and .txt files.

Type ```make``` to compile the sources, you will get executable file *"entropy"*.

Type ```./entropy -k=100000 -fin=fin_sample.txt``` or ```./entropy -k=100000 -hist=hist_sample.txt``` to experiment on the fingerprint "fin\_sample.txt" or histogram "hist\_sample.txt" respectively, which are both the statistic of 3,000 samples generated by the uniform distribution over 100,000 symbols. 

### Program arguments

#### Main arguments:

* ```-k=number```: set alphabet size. 
* ```-fin=filename```: set fingerprint input file. 
  Each line of file consists of two numbers: frequency *j*, the number of symbols that appears exactly *j* times.
* ```-hist=filename```: set histogram input file. 
  Each line of file consists of only one number: frequency *j*. Symbols are not needed.
* *k* must be provided. 
  Either *fin* or *hist* must be provided.
  If both *fin* and *hist* are provided, only *fin* will be read.
  
#### Optional arguments:

* ```-L=number```: set polynomial degree. Default *L=1.6 log k*.
* ```-M=number```: set the right endpoint of approximation interval. Default *M=3.5 log k*.
* ```-N=number```: set the threshold to apply the polynomial estimator. Default *N=1.6 log k*.
* The parameters above can be combined, e.g., ```./entropy -k=100000 -fin=fin_sample.txt -L=18 -M=40 -N=18```.
* Type ```./entropy -help``` or ```./entropy -h``` to see the list of arguments.



## More for developers
For developer who want to write a new test scratch to test the entropy estimator, follow the example *main_test.cpp*.
After ```make``` you will also see the executable file *"test"*.

### Entropy estimator class: *Entropy*
Work flow: 

1. Set alphabet size *k* and several parameters: 
  * **setDegree(int L)**: the degree of polynomial is L.
  * **setInterval(int M)**: the approximation interval is [0,M/n], where n is the sample size.
  * **setThreshold(int N)**: the threshold to use polynomial estimator is when the histogram is at most N.
2. Input fingerprint or histogram. Use one of the following: 
  * **setFin( filename )**: each line of file consists of two numbers: frequency *j*, the number of symbols that appears exactly *j* times.
  * **setFin( freq, count )**: input two vectors of the same length: *freq[i]* represents frequency, and *count[i]* counts the number of symbols that appear exactly *freq[i]* times. 
  * **setHist( filename )**: each line of file consists of one number: frequency *j*. Symbols are not needed.
  * **setHist( freq )**: input one vector with frequencies.
3. Output various estimates: 
  * **estimate()**: our polynomial estimator
  * **estimate_plug()**: plug-in estimator
  * **estimate\_Miller\_Madow()**: Miller-Madow estimator



### Synthetic data experiments
For those who want to generate synthetic samples within C++, you can refer to the standard [random number generator facilities](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/).
There are examples to generate random numbers according to different types of distributions.
If the distribution is not yet provided, you can use the general [discrete distribution](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/discrete\_distribution/).
There are several ways to [construct discrete distributions](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/discrete\_distribution/discrete\_distribution/).


## Reference
For detailed explanation of parameters, please refer to our paper [Minimax rates of entropy estimation on large alphabets via best polynomial approximation, arXiv:1407.0381](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0381).
The parameters described in the paper are: *L=c<sub>0</sub> log k, M=c<sub>1</sub> log k, N=c<sub>2</sub> log k*.
As in the paper, the default values are *L=1.6 log k, M=3.5 log k, N=1.6 log k*.
